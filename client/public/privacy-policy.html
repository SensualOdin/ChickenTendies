  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

  <p>ChickenTinders ("we," "our," or "us") operates the ChickenTinders mobile application and website (collectively, the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Service.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>Account Information</h3>
  <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>First and last name</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Authentication is handled through Supabase, a third-party authentication provider. We do not store your password.</p>

  <h3>Location Data</h3>
  <p>With your permission, we collect your approximate location (latitude and longitude) to find nearby restaurants. Location coordinates used in analytics are truncated to reduce precision and protect your privacy. You can deny location access and manually enter an address instead.</p>

  <h3>Usage and Analytics Data</h3>
  <p>We collect anonymized usage data to improve the Service, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Restaurant swipe actions (likes and dislikes)</li>
    <li>Cuisine and price preferences</li>
    <li>Session and crew participation</li>
    <li>Approximate time of activity (day of week, hour of day)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>User IDs in analytics data are hashed and cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

  <h3>Push Notification Tokens</h3>
  <p>If you opt in to push notifications, we store your device push token to send you notifications about crew activity and restaurant matches.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and operate the Service (finding restaurants, matching with your crew)</li>
    <li>To personalize your experience based on dining preferences</li>
    <li>To send push notifications you have opted into</li>
    <li>To analyze aggregated, anonymized usage patterns to improve the Service</li>
    <li>To maintain security and prevent abuse</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the following third-party services that may process your data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Supabase</strong> - Authentication and database hosting</li>
    <li><strong>Google Places API</strong> - Restaurant information and photos</li>
    <li><strong>Yelp Fusion API</strong> - Restaurant information, ratings, and photos</li>
    <li><strong>Render</strong> - Application hosting</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each third-party service is governed by its own privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share data only in the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>With other members of your crew (your display name and swipe activity within that crew)</li>
    <li>With third-party services listed above, as necessary to operate the Service</li>
    <li>If required by law or to protect our rights</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your account information for as long as your account is active. Analytics data is retained in anonymized form. You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time by contacting us.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable security measures including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS), hashed identifiers in analytics, rate limiting, and secure authentication tokens. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Service is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected such information, we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access the personal data we hold about you</li>
    <li>Request correction of inaccurate data</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your data</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent for location access or push notifications at any time through your device settings</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the Service or by other means. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
